The sum, difference, \PMlinkname{product}{Ring} and quotient of two non-zero real numbers, from which one is rational and the other irrational, is irrational.

{\em Proof.} \,Let $a$ be a rational and $\alpha$ irrational number. \,Here we prove only that $\frac{a}{\alpha}$ is irrational --- the other cases are similar. \,If \,$\frac{a}{\alpha}$ were a rational number \,$r \neq 0$, \,then also \,$\alpha = ar^{-1}$\, would be rational as a product of two rationals. \,This contradiction shows that $\frac{a}{\alpha}$ is irrational.

\textbf{Note.} \,In the result, the words real, rational and irrational may be replaced resp. by the words complex, algebraic and transcendental or resp. by the words complex, real and \PMlinkescapetext{imaginary} (the last \PMlinkescapetext{term} here meaning, as commonly in Continental Europe, a complex number having non-zero imaginary part).
