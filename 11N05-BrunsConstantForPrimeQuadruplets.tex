\begin{document}
{\em Brun's constant for prime quadruplets} is the sum of the reciprocals of all prime quadruplets
\begin{equation*}
B_4 = \sum_{\substack{p\\p + 2 \text{ is prime}\\p + 6 \text{ is prime}\\p + 8 \text{ is prime}}} \left(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{p + 2} + \frac{1}{p + 6} + \frac{1}{p + 8} \right)\approx 0.8705883800.
\end{equation*}

Viggo Brun proved that the constant exists by using a new sieving method, which later became known as \PMlinkname{Brun's sieve}{BrunsPureSieve}.
