\begin{document}
Given an integer $m$ consisting of $k$ digits $d_1, \dots, d_k$ in base $b$, let $$j = \prod_{i = 1}^{k} d_i,$$ then repeat this operation on the digits of $j$ until $j < b$. This stores in $j$ the {\em multiplicative digital root} of $m$. The number of iterations of the multiplication operation is called the {\em multiplicative persistence} of $m$.
