\begin{document}
Given an integer $n$, count how many integers $m$ in the set $\{n + 1, n + 2, \ldots n^2\}$ satisfy $\phi(m) = n$. This is the {\em totient valence} of $n$, usually labelled $N_{\phi}(n)$. (The only two special cases are 2 and 6, for which one has to look a little beyound $n^2$).

Robert Carmichael conjectured that $N_{\phi}(n) = 1$ never. Two sequences in Sloane's OEIS that list numbers with higher totient valences than preceding numbers are A007374 and A097942.
