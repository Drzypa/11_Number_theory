In 1960 Wac{\l}aw Sierpi\'nski (1882-1969) proved the following interesting result:

\textbf{Theorem:}
There exist infinitely many odd integers $k$ such that 
$k2^n + 1$ is composite for every integer $n \geq 1$. 

A multiplier $k$ with this property
is called a \PMlinkname{Sierpi\'nski number}{SierpinskiNumbers}.
The Sierpi\'nski problem consists in
determining the smallest Sierpi\'nski number.
In 1962, John Selfridge discovered the Sierpi\'nski number $k = 78557$,
which is now believed to be in fact the smallest such number. 

\textbf{Conjecture:}
The integer $k = 78557$ is the smallest Sierpi\'nski number.

To prove the conjecture, it would be sufficient to exhibit
a prime $k2^n+1$ for each $k < 78557$.
