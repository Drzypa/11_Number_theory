\begin{document}
In the base 10 representation of $\pi$, at positions 762 through 767 (after the decimal point) there are six instances of the digit 9, called the {\em Feynman point}. Physicist Richard Feynman joked that he wanted to memorize $\pi$ up to that point: 3.14159265358979323846264338 ... 77130996051870721134999999... Such a recitation would erroneously suggest that $\pi$ is a rational number, the quotient of two integers that happen to be coprime to the base.
