This was first proven by David Wilson, a major contributor to Sloane's Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.

First, Wilson proved that $10^{m - 1} \le n$ (where $m$ is the number of digits of $n$) and that $$\sum_{i = 1}^m d_i \le 9m$$ and $$\prod_{i = 1}^m d_i \le 9^m$$. The only way to fulfill the inequality $10^{m - 1} \le 9^m9m$ is for $m \le 84$.

Thus, a base 10 sum-product number can't have more than 84 digits. From the first $10^{84}$ integers, we can discard all those integers with 0's in their decimal representation. We can further eliminate those integers whose product of digits is not of the form $2^i3^j7^k$ or $3^i5^j7^k$.

Having thus reduced the number of integers to consider, a brute force search by computer yields the finite set of sum-product numbers in base 10: 0, 1, 135 and 144.
