The {\em Kn\"odel numbers} $K_n$ for a given positive integer $n$ are the set of composite integers $m > n$ such that any $b < m$ coprime to $m$ satisfies $b^{m - n} \equiv 1 \mod m$. The Carmichael numbers are $K_1$. There are infinitely many Knodel number $K_n$ for a given $n$, something which was first proven only for $n > 2$. Erd\H{o}s speculated that this was also true for $n = 1$ but two decades passed before this was conclusively proved by Alford, Granville and Pomerance.
