Suppose that an odd prime number $p$ can be written as the sum
$$p \;=\; a^2\!+\!b^2$$
where $a$ and $b$ are integers.\, Then they have to be coprime.\, 
We will show that $p$ is of the form $4n\!+\!1$.

Since\, $p \nmid b$,\, the congruence
$$bb_1 \;\equiv\; 1 \pmod p$$
has a solution $b_1$, whence
$$0 \;\equiv\; pb_1^2 \;=\; (ab_1)^2\!+\!(bb_1)^2 \;\equiv\; (ab_1)^2\!+\!1 \pmod p,$$
and thus
$$(ab_1)^2 \;\equiv\; -1 \pmod p.$$
Consequently, the Legendre symbol $\left(\frac{-1}{p}\right)$ is $+1$, i.e.
$$(-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \;=\; 1.$$
Therefore, we must have
\begin{align}
p \;=\; 4n\!+\!1
\end{align}
where $n$ is a positive integer.  \\


Euler has first proved the following theorem presented by 
Fermat and containing also the converse of the above claim.

\textbf{Theorem 
(\PMlinkname{Thue's lemma}{ThuesLemma}).}\, An odd prime $p$ is 
uniquely expressible as sum of two squares of integers if and 
only if it satisfies (1) with an integer value of $n$.\\

The theorem implies easily the 

\textbf{Corollary.}\, If all odd prime factors of a positive 
integer are congruent to 1 modulo 4 then the integer is a sum
of two squares. (Cf. the proof of the parent article and the article 
``\PMlinkname{prime factors of Pythagorean hypotenuses}{primefactorsofpythagoreanhypotenuses}''.)
