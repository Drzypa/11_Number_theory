 \begin{theorem} 
Assume $n  \geq 2$ is an integer  and that $P$ is a polynomial with coefficients in $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$. If $P(n)$ is prime then $P(x)$ is \PMlinkname{irreducible}{IrreduciblePolynomial2} in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$.
 \end{theorem}
A proof is given in \cite{MRM}.

 A. Cohn \cite{PZ} proved this theorem for the case $n=10$.



This special case of the above theorem is sketched as problem 128, Part VIII, in \cite{PZ}.
