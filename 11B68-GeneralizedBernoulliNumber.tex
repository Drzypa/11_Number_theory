\begin{document}
Let $\chi$ be a non-trivial primitive character mod $m$.  The generalized Bernoulli numbers $B_{n,\chi}$ are given by
\[
\sum_{a=1}^m \chi(a)\frac{te^{at}}{e^{mt}-1}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty B_{n,\chi}\frac{t^n}{n!}
\]
They are members of the field $\mathbb{Q}(\chi)$ generated by the values of $\chi$.
