\begin{document}
A {\em tacit multiplication operator} is a multiplication operator not actually written in a formula but usually understood from the context, at least by humans. For example, the expression $2\pi r$ is understood to mean $2 \times \pi \times r$. Most advanced computer algebra systems (such as Mathematica) and even the Google calculator are capable of understanding the tacit multiplication operator provided that it does not clash in meaning with another possible command.
