Loosely speaking, a mean is a way to describe a collection of numbers such
that the mean in some sense describe the ``average'' entry of these numbers. 
The most familiar mean is the arithmetic mean, and unless otherwise noted, by mean,
we always mean the arithmetic mean. 

\subsubsection*{Example} 
The mean of the numbers $\{1,\,2,\,\ldots,\,n\}$ is $\frac{n+1}{2}$. 

Mathematically, we define a mean as follows:

\subsubsection*{Definition}
A \emph{mean} is a function $f$ whose domain is the collection of
all finite multisets of $\mathbb{R}$ and whose codomain is $\mathbb{R}$, 
such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $f$ is a homogeneous function of degree 1.\, That is, if $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$ is a multiset, then 
$$ 
  f(\{ \lambda x_1, \ldots, \lambda x_n\}) = \lambda f(\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}),\quad \lambda\ge 0.
$$
\item For any set $S = \{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ of real numbers,
$$ \min\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\} \leq f(S) \leq \max\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}.$$
\end{itemize}

Pythagoras identified three types of means: the \PMlinkname{arithmetic mean}{ArithmeticMean}, the geometric
mean, and the harmonic mean. However, in the sense of the above definition, 
there is a wealth of ther means too. For instance, the minimum function and maximum
functions can be seen as ``trivial'' means. Other well-known means include: 

\begin{itemize}
\item median, 
\item mode, 
\item generalized mean
\item power mean
\item Lehmer mean
\item arithmetic-geometric mean, 
\item arithmetic-harmonic mean, 
\item harmonic-geometric mean, 
\item root-mean-square (sometimes called the quadratic mean), 
\item identric mean, 
\item contraharmonic mean,
\item Heronian mean, 
\item Cesaro mean,
\item \PMlinkname{maximum function, minimum function}{MinimalAndMaximalNumber}
\end{itemize}
