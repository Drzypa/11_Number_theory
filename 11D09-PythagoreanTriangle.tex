The side lengths of any right triangle satisfy the equation of the Pythagorean theorem, 
but if they are integers then the triangle is a {\it Pythagorean triangle}.

The side lengths are said to form a Pythagorean triple.\, They are always different 
integers, the smallest of them being at least 3.\\

Any Pythagorean triangle has the property that the hypotenuse is 
the contraharmonic mean 
\begin{align}
c \;=\; \frac{u^2\!+\!v^2}{u\!+\!v}
\end{align}
and one cathetus is the harmonic mean 
\begin{align}
h \;=\; \frac{2uv}{u\!+\!v}
\end{align}
of a certain pair of distinct positive integers $u$, $v$; the
other cathetus is simply $|u\!-\!v|$.\\

If there is given the value of $c$ as the length of the 
hypotenuse and a compatible value\, $h$ as the length of one 
cathetus, the pair of equations (1) and (2) does not determine 
the numbers $u$ and $v$ uniquely (cf. the Proposition 4 in the 
entry integer contraharmonic means).\, For example, if\, 
$c = 61$\, and\, $h = 11$, then the equations give for\, 
$(u, v)$\, either\, $(6,\,66)$\, or\, $(55,\,66)$.\\


As for the hypotenuse and (1), the proof is found in [1] and also 
in the PlanetMath article contraharmonic means and Pythagorean 
hypotenuses.\, The contraharmonic and the harmonic mean of two 
integers are simultaneously integers (see 
\PMlinkname{this article}{IntegerHarmonicMeans}).\, The above 
claim concerning the catheti of the Pythagorean triangle is 
evident from the identity
$$\left(\frac{2uv}{u\!+\!v}\right)^2\!+\!\left|u\!-\!v\right|^2 
\;=\; \left(\frac{u^2\!+\!v^2}{u\!+\!v}\right)^2.$$\\


If the catheti of a Pythagorean triangle are $a$ and $b$,
then the values of the parameters $u$ and $v$ determined by 
the equations (1) and (2) are
\begin{align}
\frac{c\!+\!b\!\pm\!a}{2}
\end{align}
as one instantly sees by substituting them into the equations.
