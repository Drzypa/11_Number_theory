\begin{document}
The \emph{content of a polynomial} $f$ may be defined in any polynomial ring $R[x]$ over a commutative ring $R$ as the ideal of $R$ generated by the coefficients of the polynomial.\, It is denoted by $\operatorname{cont}(f)$ or $c(f)$.\, Coefficient module is a little more general concept.\\

If $R$ is a \PMlinkname{unique factorisation domain}{UFD} and\, $f,\,g \in R[x]$,\, the Gauss lemma I 
implies \footnote{In a UFD, one can use as contents of $f$ and $g$ the \PMlinkid{greatest common divisors}{5800} $a$ and $b$ of the coefficients of these polynomials, when one has\, $f(x) = af_1(x)$,\; $g(x) = bg_1(x)$\, with $f_1(x)$ and $g_1(x)$ primitive polynomials.\, Then\, $f(x)g(x) = abf_1(x)g_1(x)$,\, and since also $f_1g_1$ is a primitive polynomial, we see that\, $c(fg) = ab = c(f)c(g)$.} that
\begin{align}
c(fg) \;=\; c(f)c(g).
\end{align}

For an arbitrary commutative ring $R$, there is only the containment
\begin{align}
c(fg) \;\subseteq\; c(f)c(g)
\end{align}
(cf. product of finitely generated ideals).\, The ideal $c(fg)$ is called the \emph{Gaussian ideal of} the polynomials
$f$ and $g$.\, The polynomial $f$ in $R[x]$ is a \PMlinkescapetext{\emph{Gaussian polynomial}}, if (2) becomes the equality (1) for all polynomials $g$ in the ring $R[x]$.\, The ring $R$ is a \emph{Gaussian ring}, if all polynomials in 
$R[x]$ are \PMlinkescapetext{Gaussian polynomials}.\\

It's quite interessant, that the equation (1) multiplied by the power $[c(f)]^n$, where $n$ is the degree of the other polynomial $g$, however is true in any commutative ring $R$, thus replacing the containment (2):
\begin{align}
[c(f)]^nc(fg) \;=\; [c(f)]^{n+1}c(g).
\end{align}
This result is called the 
\emph{Hilfssatz von Dedekind--Mertens}, i.e. the 
Dedekind--Mertens lemma.\, A generalised form of it is in the 
entry 
\PMlinkname{product of finitely generated ideals}{ProductOfFinitelyGeneratedIdeals}.
