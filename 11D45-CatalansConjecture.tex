\begin{document}
The successive positive integers 8 and 9 are integer powers of positive integers ($2^3$ and $3^2$), with exponents greater than 1. {\em Catalan's conjecture} (1844) said that there are no other such successive positive integers, i.e. that the only integer solution of the Diophantine equation
$$x^m-y^n = 1$$
with\; $x > 1$,\, $y > 1$,\, $m > 1$,\, $n > 1$\; is
$$x = n = 3, \quad y = m = 2.$$

It took more than 150 years before the conjecture was proven.  Mihailescu gave in 2002 a proof in which he used the theory of cyclotomic fields and Galois modules.
