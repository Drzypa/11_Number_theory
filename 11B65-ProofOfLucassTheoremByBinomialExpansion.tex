\begin{document}
We work with polynomials in $x$ over the integers modulo $p$.  \newline By
the binomial theorem we have $(1+x)^p = 1 + x^p$.   More
generally, by induction on $i$ we have $(1+x)^{p^i} = 1+x^{p^i}$.


Hence the following holds:

$$
(1+x)^n=(1+x)^{\left[\sum_{i=0}^{k}a_i p^i \right ]} =
\prod_{i=0}^k (1+x^{p^i})^{a_i} = \prod_{i=0}^k \sum_{b=0}^{a_i}
{{a_i}\choose {b}} x^{bp^i}
$$

Then the coefficient on $x^m$ on the left hand side is $n \choose
m$.

As $m$ is uniquely \PMlinkescapetext{expressible} base $p$, the coefficient on $x^m$
on the right hand side is $\prod_{i=0}^k {a_i \choose b_i}$.

Equating the coefficients on $x^m$ on either \PMlinkescapetext{side} therefore yields
the result.
