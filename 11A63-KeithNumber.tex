\begin{document}
Given a base $b$ integer $$n = \sum_{i = 1}^k d_ib^{i - 1}$$ where $d_1$ is the least significant digit and $d_k$ is the most significant, construct the sequence $a_1 = d_k, \ldots a_k = d_1$, and for $m > k$, $$a_m = \sum_{i = 1}^k a_{m - i}.$$ If there is an $x$ such that $a_x = n$, then $n$ is a {\em Keith number} or {\em repfigit number}.

In base 10, the first few Keith numbers below ten thousand are: 14, 19, 28, 47, 61, 75, 197, 742, 1104, 1537, 2208, 2580, 3684, 4788, 7385, 7647, 7909 (see A007629 in Sloane's OEIS for a longer listing). 47 is a base 10 Keith number because it is contained the Fibonacci-like recurrence started from its base 10 digits: 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, etc.
