\begin{document}
Construct a recurrence relation with initial terms $a_0 = 3$, $a_1 = 0$, $a_2 = 2$ and $a_n = a_{n - 3} + a_{n - 2}$ for $n > 2$. The first few terms of the sequence defined by this recurrence relation are: 3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, 17, 22, 29, 39, 51, 68, 90, 119, 158, 209, 277, 367 (listed in A001608 of Sloane's OEIS). This is the {\em Perrin sequence}, sometimes called the {\em Ondrej Such sequence}. Its generating function is $$G(a(n);x)=\frac{3-x^2}{1-x^2-x^3}.$$ A number in the Perrin sequence is called a \emph{Perrin number}.

It has been observed that if $n|a_n$, then $n$ is a prime number, at least among the first hundred thousand integers or so. However, the square of 521 passes this test.

The $n$th Perrin number asymptotically matches the $n$th power of the plastic constant.
