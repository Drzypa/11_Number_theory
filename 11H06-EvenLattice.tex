\begin{document}
A lattice $L$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is \PMlinkescapetext{even} if the norm of every vector in $L$ is an even integer.  Note that because of the polarization identity $$(x,y) = \frac{(x+y,x+y) - (x,x) - (y,y)}{2}$$ it follows that all scalar products in an even lattice are \PMlinkescapetext{integral}.
