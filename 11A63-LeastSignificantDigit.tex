\begin{document}
The {\em least significant digit} of a number $n$ written in a given positional base $b$ is the digit in the least significant place value, and has to be in the range $-1 < d_1 < b$. In the case of an integer, the least significant digit is the 1's place value, usually written to the right of the $b$'s place value. In the case of a transcendental number, there is no actual least significant digit, but for computational purposes the rational approximation would have a least significant digit.

In an array of digits $k$ long meant for mathematical manipulation, it might be convenient to index the least significant digit with index 1 or 0, and the more significant digits with larger integers. (This enables the calculation of the value of a given digit as $d_ib^i$  rather than $d_ib^{k - i}$.) For an array of digits meant for text string manipulation, however, the least significant digit might be placed at position $k$ (for example, by Mathematica's IntegerDigits function).

In binary, the least significant digit is often called the {\em least significant bit}.
