\begin{document}
Given a base $b$ integer $$n = \sum_{i = 1}^k d_ib^{i - 1}$$ where $d_1$ is the least significant digit and $d_k$ is the most significant, if it's also the case that the $k$ least significant digits of $mn^2$ are the same of those of $n$, then $n$ is called an {\em automorphic number}, or an $m$-{\em automorphic number}.

Neither $b$ nor $b + 1$ can be 1-automorphic in base $b$.
