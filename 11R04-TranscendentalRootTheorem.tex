Suppose a constant $x$ is transcendental over some field $F$. Then $\sqrt[n]{x}$ is also transcendental over $F$ for any $n\geq 1$. 

\begin{proof}
Let $\overline{F}$ denote an algebraic closure of $F$.  Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\sqrt[n]{x}\in\overline{F}$.  Then since algebraic numbers are closed under multiplication (and thus exponentiation by positive integers), we have $(\sqrt[n]{x})^n=x\in \overline{F}$, so that $x$ is algebraic over $F$, creating a contradiction.
\end{proof}
