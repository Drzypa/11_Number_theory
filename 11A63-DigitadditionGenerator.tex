\begin{document}
Given an integer $m$ consisting of $k$ digits $d_x$ in base $b$, it follows that $$m + \sum_{i = 0}^{k - 1} d_{i + 1}b^i = n$$, another integer. Then $m$ is said to be the {\em digitaddition generator} of $n$.

In a randomly chosen range of $2b$ consecutive integers, most will have a digitaddition generator and one or two might have none (such integers are called self numbers). If the range falls near a multiple of $b^2$, it might contain a few numbers with two digitaddition generators. If the range includes $0 < n < b$ and $2|b$, the $n \not\vert 2$ will lack digitaddition generators.
