\begin{defn} For $x>0$ real, $q,a$ positive integers, we define
\[\pi(x;q,a)=\sum_{\substack{p\leq x\\p\equiv a\pmod q\\p \text{ prime}}} 1\]
i.e. the number of primes not exceeding $x$ that are congruent to $a$ modulo $q$.
\end{defn}

Then the following holds:
\begin{thm} (Siegel) For all $A>0$, there is some constant $c=c(A)>0$ such that
\[\pi(x;q,a) = \frac{Li(x)}{\varphi(q)} + \bigoh\left(x\exp(-c\sqrt{\log x})\right)\]
for every $1\leq q\leq (\log x)^A$ with $\gcd(q,a)=1$.
\end{thm}

Note that it follows from this theorem that the distribution of primes among invertible residue classes $\mod q$ does not depend on the residue class - that is, primes are evenly distributed into such classes.

A form of Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions states that
\[\frac{\pi(x;q,a)}{\pi(x)} \sim \frac{1}{\varphi(q)}\]
This follows easily from \PMlinkescapetext{Siegel's theorem} on noting that $Li(x) = \frac{x}{\log x}+\cdots$.
