\begin{document}
A {\sl biquadratic extension\/} of a field $F$ is a Galois extension $K$ of $F$ such that $\operatorname{Gal} (K/F)$ is isomorphic to the Klein 4-group.  It receives its name from the fact that any such $K$ is the compositum of two distinct quadratic extensions of $F$.  The name can be somewhat misleading, however, since biquadratic extensions of $F$ have exactly three distinct subfields that are quadratic extensions of $F$.  This is easily seen to be true by the fact that the Klein 4-group has exactly three distinct subgroups of \PMlinkname{order}{OrderGroup} 2.

Note that, if $\alpha, \beta \in F$, then $F(\sqrt{\alpha}, \sqrt{\beta})$ is a biquadratic extension of $F$ if and only if none of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\alpha \beta$ are squares in $F$.
