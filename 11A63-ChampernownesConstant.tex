\begin{document}
For a given base $b$, {\em Champernowne's constant} $C_b$ is the result of concatenating the base $b$ digits of the positive integers in order after 0 and a decimal point, that is, $$\sum_{i = 1}^\infty \frac{i}{b^{\sum_{j = 1}^i k}}$$ (where $k$ is the number of digits of $j$ in base $b$).

Kurt Mahler proved that $C_{10}$ (approximately 0.123456789101112131415161718192021...) is a transcendental number. Champernowne had earlier proved that $C_{10}$ is a normal number.
