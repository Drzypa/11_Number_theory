Let $E_k$ be the elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables and $S_k$ be defined by 
\[ S_k(x_1, ... , x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i^k}. \]

Then the $S_k$ and $E_k$ are related as follows:
\begin{align*}
S_1 &= E_1 \\
S_2 &= S_1 E_1 - 2E_2 \\
S_3 &= S_2 E_1 - S_1 E_2 + 3E_3\\
 &\vdots \\
S_k &= -\left(\sum_{j=1}^{k-1} {(-1)^j S_{k-j} E_j} \right) - (-1)^k k E_k 
\end{align*}

%or even more succinctly as

%\[ \sum_{j=0}^{k} {(-1)^j S_{k-j} E_j} = 0, \text{     }  1 \leq n \leq k \]

By applying these formulas recursively, $S_k$ can be expressed solely in terms of the $E_k$, which is often desirable. For example, since $S_1 = E_1$, $S_2 = E_1^2 - 2E_2$, and then $S_3 = (E_1^2-2E_2)E_1 - E_1 E_2 + 3E_3 = E_1^3 - 3E_1 E_2 + 3E_3$, and so on.

Note that $E_0 = 1$ and  $E_k=0$ for $k > n$.
