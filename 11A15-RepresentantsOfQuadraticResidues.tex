\textbf{Theorem.}\, Let $p$ be a positive odd prime number.\, Then the integers
\begin{align}
1^2,\,2^2,\,\ldots,\,\left(\frac{p\!-\!1}{2}\right)^{\!2}
\end{align}
constitute a \PMlinkescapetext{complete} representant system of incongruent quadratic residues modulo $p$.\, Accordingly, there are $\frac{p\!-\!1}{2}$ quadratic residues and equally many nonresidues modulo $p$.\\

\emph{Proof.}\, Firstly, the numbers (1), being squares, are quadratic residues modulo $p$.\, Secondly, they are incongruent, because a congruence \,$a^2 \equiv b^2 \pmod{p}$\, would imply
$$p \mid a\!+\!b \quad \mbox{or} \quad p \mid a\!-\!b,$$
which is impossible when $a$ and $b$ are different integers among $1,\,2,\,\ldots,\,\frac{p\!-\!1}{2}$.\, Third, if $c$ is any quadratic residue modulo $p$, and therefore the congruence \,$x^2 \equiv c \pmod{p}$\, has a solution $x$, then $x$ is congruent with one of the numbers
$$\pm1,\,\pm2,\,\ldots,\,\pm\frac{p\!-\!1}{2}$$
which form a reduced residue system modulo $p$ (see absolutely least remainders).\, Then $x^2$ and $c$ are congruent with one of the numbers (1).
