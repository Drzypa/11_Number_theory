\begin{document}
If the prime factor decomposition of a positive integer $n$ is
\begin{align}
n \;=\; p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdots p_r^{\alpha_r},
\end{align}
then all positive divisors of $n$ are of the form
$$
p_1^{\nu_1}p_2^{\nu_2}\cdots p_r^{\nu_r} \quad\mbox{where}\quad 0 \le \nu_i \le \alpha_i \quad(i = 1,\,2,\,\ldots,\,r).
$$
Thus the total number of the divisors is
\begin{align}
\tau(n) \;=\; (\alpha_1\!+\!1)(\alpha_2\!+\!1)\cdots(\alpha_r\!+\!1).
\end{align}


From this we see that in \PMlinkescapetext{order} to $\tau(n)$ be an odd number, every sum $\alpha_i\!+\!1$ shall be odd, i.e. every exponent $\alpha_i$ in (1) must be even.\, It means that $n$ has an even number of each of its prime divisors $p_i$; so $n$ is a square of an integer, a perfect square.

Consequently, the number of all positive divisors of an integer is always even, except if the integer is a perfect square.\\

\textbf{Examples}.\, 15 has four positive divisors 1, 3, 5, 15 and the square number 16 five divisors\\ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.
