\begin{document}
Given a base $b$ integer $n$ with $k$ digits $d_1, \ldots, d_k$ (with $d_1$ being the least significant digit), and an integer $1 < m < b$, if it is the case that $$m(\sum_{i = 1}^k d_ib^{i - 1}) = d_1b^{k - 1} + (\sum_{i = 2}^k d_ib^{i - 2}),$$ then $n$ is called an $m$-{\em parasitic number} or $m$-{\em left-transposable number}.

If one takes an $m$-parasitic number, concatenates copies of its digits in order whatever number of times one wants, the resulting new number will also be $m$-parasitic.
