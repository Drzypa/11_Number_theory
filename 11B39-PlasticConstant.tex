Given the equation $P^3 = P + 1$, solve for $P$. The only solution in real numbers is $P = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{6}\sqrt{\frac{23}{3}}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{6}\sqrt{\frac{23}{3}}} = \frac{\sqrt[3]{12(9+\sqrt{69})}+\sqrt[3]{12(9-\sqrt{69})}}{6} \approx 1.3247179572447$, and $P$ is the \emph{plastic constant}, also known as the \emph{silver number}.

Another way to calculate the plastic constant is ${{P(n)} \over {P(n - 1)}}$, where $P(n)$ is the $n^{th}$ term of either the Padovan sequence or the Perrin sequence. For about $n > 20$ the approximation is adequate for all practical purposes.
