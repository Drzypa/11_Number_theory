The following is a corollary of Minkowski's theorem on ideal classes, which is a corollary of Minkowski's theorem on lattices.

\begin{defn}
Let $S=\{p_1,\ldots,p_r\}$ be a set of rational primes $p_i \in \Ints$. We say that a number field $K$ is {\bf unramified outside $S$} if any prime not in $S$ is unramified in $K$. In other words, if $p$ is ramified in $K$, then $p\in S$. In other words, the only primes that divide the discriminant of $K$ are elements of $S$.
\end{defn}

\begin{cor}[Hermite's Theorem]
Let $S=\{p_1,\ldots,p_r\}$ be a set of rational primes $p_i \in \Ints$ and let $N\in \Nats$ be arbitrary. There is only a finite number of fields $K$ which are unramified outside $S$ and bounded degree $[K:\Rats]\leq N$.
