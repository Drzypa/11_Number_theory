\begin{document}
Let $L/K$ be any finite Galois extension of number fields with Galois group $G$. For any conjugacy class $C \subset G$, the subset of prime ideals $\mathfrak{p} \subset K$ which are unramified in $L$ and satisfy the property
$$
[L/K,\mathfrak{P}] \in C\ \text{for any prime }\ \mathfrak{P} \subset L\ \text{containing }\ \mathfrak{p}
$$
has analytic density $\frac{|C|}{|G|}$, where $[L/K,\mathfrak{P}]$ denotes the Artin symbol at $\mathfrak{P}$.

Note that the conjugacy class of $[L/K,\mathfrak{P}]$ is independent of the choice of prime $\mathfrak{P}$ lying over $\mathfrak{p}$, since any two such choices of primes are related by a Galois automorphism and their corresponding Artin symbols are conjugate by this same automorphism.
