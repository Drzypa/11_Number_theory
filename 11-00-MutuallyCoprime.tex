\begin{document}
Natural numbers $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$ are called \emph{mutually coprime} if there is no $p\in\mathbb{N}$, $p>1$ with $p|a_i$ for all $i\leq n$. By this definition for example $15$, $21$ and $25$ would be mutually coprime though they are not \emph{pairwise coprime}, because that would \PMlinkescapetext{mean} that each pair of these numbers is coprime.
