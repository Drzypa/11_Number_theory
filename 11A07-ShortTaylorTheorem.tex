If $f(x)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients and $x_0$ and $h$ integers, then the congruence
\begin{align}
f(x_0\!+\!h) \;\equiv\; f(x_0)+f'(x_0)h \;\; \pmod{h^2}
\end{align}
is in force.


{\it Proof.}\; Because of the linear properties of (1) we can confine us to the monomials\, $f(x) := x^n$.\, Then\, $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$.\,  By the binomial theorem we have
\begin{align}
(x_0\!+\!h)^n \;=\; x_0^n\!+\!nx_0^{n-1}h+h^2P(x_0)
\end{align}
where $P(x_0)$ is a polynomial in $x_0$ with integer coefficients.\, The equality (2) may be written as the asserted congruence (1).
