Fibonacci's application for practical numbers $n$ was an algorithm to represent proper fractions $\frac{m}{n}$ (with $m > 1$) as sums of unit fractions $\displaystyle \sum \frac{d_i}{n}$, with the $d_i$ being divisors of the practical number $n$. (By the way, there are infinitely many practical numbers which are also Fibonacci numbers). The method is:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Reduce the fraction to lowest terms. If the numerator is then 1, we're done.
\item Rewrite $m$ as a sum of divisors of $n$.
\item Make those divisors of $n$ that add up to $m$ into the numerators of fractions with $n$ as denominator.
\item Reduce those fractions to lowest terms, thus obtaining the representation $\displaystyle \frac{m}{n} = \sum \frac{d_i}{n}$.
\end{enumerate}

To illustrate the algorithm, let's rewrite $\frac{37}{42}$ as a sum of unit fractions. Since 42 is practical, success is guaranteed. 

At the first step we can't reduce this fraction because 37 is a prime number. So we go on to the second step, and represent 37 as 2 + 14 + 21. This gives us the fractions $$\frac{2}{42} + \frac{14}{42} + \frac{21}{42},$$ which we then reduce to lowest terms: $$\frac{1}{21} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2},$$ giving us the desired unit fractions.
