{\em Brocard's problem}, first posed by Henri Brocard in 1876, asks for factorials that are one less than a square, that is, solutions to the equation $n! + 1 = m^2$. Only three solutions are known: $4! + 1 = 5^2$, $5! + 1 = 11^2$ and $7! + 1 = 71^2$. Srinivasa Ramanujan also pondered the problem, in 1913. Erd\H{o}s believed that there are no other solutions, and no more have been found for $n$ up to $10^9$.
