A $k$-{\em superperfect number} $n$ is an integer such that $\sigma^k(n) = 2n$, where $\sigma^k(x)$ is the iterated sum of divisors function. For example, 16 is 2-superperfect since its divisors add up to 31, and in turn the divisors of 31 add up to 32, which is twice 16.

At first Suryanarayana only considered 2-superperfect numbers. It is easy to prove that numbers of the form $2^{p - 1}$ are 2-superperfect only if $2^p - 1$ is a Mersenne prime. The existence of odd 2-superperfect numbers appears as unlikely as that of regular odd perfect numbers.

Later, Dieter Bode generalized the concept for any $k$ and proved that when $k > 2$ there are no even $k$-superperfect numbers. Others have further generalized the concept to $(k, m)$-superperfect numbers satisifying the equality $\sigma^k(n) = mn$, and Weisstein programs a Mathematica command to default to $m = 2$ when the third argument is omitted. For example, 8, 21, and 512 are (2, 3)-superperfect, since the second iteration of the sum of divisors function gives thrice them, 24, 63, and 1536 respectively.

Not to be confused with hyperperfect numbers, which satisfy a different equality involving the sum of divisors function.
