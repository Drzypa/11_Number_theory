\begin{document}
An {\em orderly number} is an integer $n$ such that there exists at least one other integer $k$ such that each divisor of $n$ from 1 to $d_{\tau(n)}$ (with $\tau(n)$ being the number of divisors function) satisfies the congruences $d_i \equiv 1 \mod k$, $d_i \equiv 2 \mod k$ through $d_i \equiv \tau(n) \mod k$. For example, 20 is an orderly number, with $k = 7$, since it has six divisors, 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, and we can verify that

$$1 \equiv 1 \mod 7$$
$$2 \equiv 2 \mod 7$$
$$10 \equiv 3 \mod 7$$
$$4 \equiv 4 \mod 7$$
$$5 \equiv 5 \mod 7$$
$$20 \equiv 6 \mod 7$$

The orderly numbers less than 100 are 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 19, 20, 23, 27, 29, 31, 37, 38, 41, 43, 47, 52, 53, 57, 58, 59, 61, 67, 68, 71, 72, 73, 76, 79, 83, 87, 89, 97, listed in A167408 of Neil Sloane's OEIS. With the exception of 3, all prime numbers are orderly.
