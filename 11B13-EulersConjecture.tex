\begin{document}
In 1769, Leonhard Euler conjectured that for $1 < k < n$ there is no set of positive integers $a_1, \ldots, a_k$ such that $$\sum_{i = 1}^k {a_i}^n = m^n,$$ where $m$ is an integer. Lander and Parkin in 1966 disproved the conjecture with this $k = 4, n = 5$ counterexample: $27^5 + 84^5 + 110^5 + 133^5 = 144^5$. More counterexamples have been discovered since then.
