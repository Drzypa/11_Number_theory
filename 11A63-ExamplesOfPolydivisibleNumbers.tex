Obviously, if one knows a polydivisible number with $k$ digits then one automatically also knows $k - 1$ other polydivisible numbers.

A consequence of a number being polydivisible is that it's also divisible by the number of digits it has. Taking sequence A098952 from Sloane's OEIS and striking out: first, odd numbers less than 10; second, in the range $99 < i < 1000$, all numbers where $d_2 \not\vert 2$; etc., we obtain the sequence of base 10 polydivisible numbers: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 102, 105, 108, 120, 123, 126, 129, 132, 135, 138, 141, etc.
