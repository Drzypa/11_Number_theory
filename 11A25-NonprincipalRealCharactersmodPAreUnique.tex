\begin{document}
\begin{thm} Let $p$ be a prime. Then there is a unique nonprincipal real Dirichlet character $\chi \mod p$, given by
\[\chi(n)=\Leg{n}{p}\]
\end{thm}
\textbf{Proof. }
Note first that $\chi(n)=\Leg{n}{p}$ is obviously a nonprincipal real character $\mod p$. Now, suppose $\chi$ is any nonprincipal real character $\mod p$. Choose some generator, $a$, of $(\Ints/p\Ints)^*$. Clearly $\chi(a)=-1$ (since otherwise $\chi$ is principal), and thus $\chi(a^k)=(-1)^k$. Since $a^{p-1}=1$, and no lower power of $a$ is $1$, it follows that $\chi$ is $-1$ on exactly $(p-1)/2$ elements of $(\Ints/p\Ints)^*$ and is $1$ on exactly $(p-1)/2$ elements. However, since $\chi(x^2)=\chi(x)^2=1$, $\chi$ is $1$ on each of the $(p-1)/2$ squares in $(\Ints/p\Ints)^*$. Thus $\chi$ is $1$ on squares and $-1$ on nonsquares, so $\chi(n)=\Leg{n}{p}$.

Note that this result is not true if $p$ is not prime. For example, the following is a table of Dirichlet characters modulo $8$, all of which are real:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|rrrr}
&$\chi_1$&$\chi_2$&$\chi_3$&$\chi_4$\\
\hline\\
$1$&$1$&$1$&$1$&$1$\\
$3$&$1$&$1$&$-1$&$-1$\\
$5$&$1$&$-1$&$1$&$-1$\\
$7$&$1$&$-1$&$-1$&$1$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
