1    \section{ Division Factorial}
The prospect of the {Division Factorial} follows the same concept of multiplicative factor. The same operations known since the twelfth century. The same logical properties that would be studied later in 1808 by the mathematician {Christian Kramp} which introduced the notation {n!}. Stirling also presented a formula approach to these results.
However, it is urgent to talk about {divisive factor}. As you think of the beginning, not the multiplicative inversion extensive. It is elementary that the corporeality of Factor Theory arises simply. About natural number {n} which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to {n}.
Demonstrate exemplary one truth and accuracy, which supports more than a demonstration \cite {PF}. Likewise, presents the multiplicative factor, which has similar properties thereto. Therefore, evidenced in the following series:
\[
1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 = 8333...\times10^3
\]
applied by;
\[
\frac{n+1}{(n+1)!}= if $ {n} $is growing,
\]
Otherwise, decreasing the following sequence:
\[
5 : 4 : 3 : 2 : 1 = 208333...\times10^1
\]
It is applied by:

\[
\frac{n}{(n-1)!}=if  $ {n} $ is decreasing,
\]
