{\bf Theorem.} For any positive integer $n$, the Zeckendorf representation $Z$ (with $k$ elements all 0s or 1s) of $n$ is unique.

For our proof, we accept it as axiomatic that $F_0 = F_1 = 1$ but $F_0$ is not used in the Zeckendorf representation of any number, and we also accept as axiomatic that all $F_i$ are distinct as long as $i > 0$.

\begin{proof}
Assume that there are two integers $a$ and $b$ such that $0 < a < b$, yet they both have the same Zeckendorf representation $Z$ with $k$ elements all 0s or 1s. We compute $$c = \sum_{i = 1}^k Z_iF_i,$$ where $F_x$ is the $x$th Fibonacci number. We can be assured that there is only one possible value for $c$ since all $F_i$ are distinct for $i > 0$ and each $F_i$ was added only once or not at all, since each $Z_i$ is limited by definition to 0 or 1. Now $c$ holds the value of the Zeckendorf representation $Z$. If $c = a$, it follows that $c < b$, but that would mean that $Z$ is not the Zeckendorf representation of $b$ after all, hence this results in a contradiction of our initial assumption. And if on the other hand $c = b$ and $c > a$, then this leads to a similar contradiction as to what is the Zeckendorf representation of $a$ really is.
