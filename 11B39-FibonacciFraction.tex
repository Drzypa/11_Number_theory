A {\em Fibonacci fraction} is a rational number of the form $\frac{F_n}{F_m}$ where $F_i$ is the $i$th number of the Fibonacci sequence and $n$ and $m$ are integers in the relation $n < m$. In the Fibonacci fractional series, each $m = n + 2$:

$$\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{8}, \frac{5}{13}, \frac{8}{21}, \frac{13}{34}, \frac{21}{55}, \frac{34}{89}, \ldots$$

The most important application of Fibonacci fractions is in botany: plants arrange the leaves on their stems (phyllotaxy) in many different ways, but ``only those conforming to a Fibonacci fraction allow for efficient packing of leaf primordia on the meristem surface.'' There is also an application in optics.
