The n-th Google number is the earliest n-digit prime number found as a substring in decimal expansion of e. Hence the first few Google numbers are 2, 271, 4523, 74713, 904523, 2718281, 72407663 ... (Sequence A095935 of OEIS). They were named due to unusual hiring ad that Google put up on a billboard on July 29, 2004.
