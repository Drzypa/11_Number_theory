A straightforward application of Fermat's theorem consists of rewriting the power of an integer mod $n$. Suppose we have $x \equiv a^b \pmod{n}$ with $a \in \mathcal{U}(n)$. Then, by Fermat's theorem we have
\begin{equation*}
a^{\phi(n)}\equiv 1 \pmod{n},
\end{equation*}
so
\begin{equation*}
x \equiv a^b (1)^k \equiv a^b (a^{\phi(n)})^k \equiv a^{b+k\phi(n)} \pmod{n}
\end{equation*}
for any integer $k$. This means we can replace $b$ by any integer congruent to it mod $\phi(n)$. In particular we have
\begin{equation*}
x \equiv a^{b \remainder \phi(n)} \pmod{n}
\end{equation*}
 where $b \remainder \phi(n)$ denotes the remainder of $b$ upon division by $\phi(n)$.

This can be used to make the computation of large powers easier. It also allows one to find an easy to compute inverse to $x^b \pmod{n}$ whenever $b \in \mathcal{U}(n)$. In fact, this is just $x^{b^{-1}}$ where $b^{-1}$ is an inverse to $b$ mod $\phi(n)$. This forms the base of the RSA cryptosystem where a message $x$ is encrypted by raising it to the $b$th power, giving $x^b$, and is decrypted by raising it to the $b^{-1}$th power, giving 
\begin{equation*}
(x^b)^{b^{-1}} \equiv x^{b b^{-1}},
\end{equation*}
which, by the above argument, is just
\begin{equation*}
x^{ b b^{-1} \remainder \phi(n)} \equiv x,
\end{equation*}
the original message!
