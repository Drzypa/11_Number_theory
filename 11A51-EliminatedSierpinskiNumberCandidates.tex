Most numbers $k$ are very easy to eliminate as Sierpi\'nski number candidates, as it is very easy to come up with sequences of primes of the form $k2^n + 1$. For example, for $k = 1$ it is enough to mention the Fermat primes. For some of the seventeen Sierpi\'nski number candidates when the Seventeen or Bust project began, only a single Proth prime, and it is often quite large. Eight candidates remain to be eliminated. The primes listed below were discovered by the Seventeen or Bust project, with the latest being for 19249, discovered by user Konstantin Agafonov of team TSC! Russia.
