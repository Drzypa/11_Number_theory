\begin{document}
A {\em Woodall number} $W_m$ is a number of the form $2^m m - 1$, where $m$ is an integer. It is believed that almost all Woodall numbers are composite. The first few Woodall numbers are 1, 7, 23, 63, 159, 383, 895, 2047, 4607 (listed in A003261 of Sloane's OEIS). Though having some things in common with the Cullen numbers, no Woodall number is a Proth number.
