\begin{document}
Given an integer $m$ consisting of $k$ digits $d_1, \dots, d_k$ in base $b$, let $$j = \sum_{i = 1}^{k} d_i,$$ then $j$ is the \emph{digit sum} of $m$. Iterating this operation on the digits of $j$ until $j < b$ gives the digital root or repeated digit sum of $m$. The digit sum and digital root of a number are the same only if the additive persistence of the digital root is 1.
