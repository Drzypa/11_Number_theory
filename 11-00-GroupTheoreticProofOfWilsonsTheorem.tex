Here we present a group theoretic proof of it.
\\Clearly, it is enough to show that
$ (p-2)!\equiv 1\pmod{p}$ since $ p-1\equiv -1\pmod{p}$.
By Sylow theorems, we have that $p$-Sylow subgroups of $S_p$, the
symmetric group on $p$ elements, have order $p$, and the number $n_p$ of
Sylow subgroups is congruent to 1 modulo $p$. Let $P$ be a Sylow subgroup
of $S_p$. Note that $P$ is generated by a $p$-cycle. There are $(p-1)!$ cycles
of length $p$ in $S_p$. Each $p$-Sylow subgroup contains $p-1$ cycles
of length $p$, hence there are $\frac{(p-1)!}{p-1}=(p-2)!$ different
$p$-Sylow subgrups in $S_p$, i.e. $n_P=(p-2)!$. From Sylow's Second
Theorem, it follows that $(p-2)!\equiv1\pmod{p}$,so $(p-1)!\equiv-1\pmod{p}$.
