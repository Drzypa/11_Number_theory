\begin{document}
According to the entry ``\PMlinkname{fractional ideal}{FractionalIdeal}'', we can \PMlinkescapetext{state} that in a Dedekind domain $R$, each non-zero integral ideal $\mathfrak{a}$ may be written as a product of finitely many prime ideals $\mathfrak{p}_i$ of $R$, 
 $$\mathfrak{a} = \mathfrak{p}_1\mathfrak{p}_2...\mathfrak{p}_k.$$
The product decomposition is unique up to the order of the factors.\, This is stated and proved, with more general assumptions, in the entry ``\PMlinkname{prime ideal factorisation is unique}{PrimeIdealFactorizationIsUnique}''.\\

\textbf{Corollary.}\, If $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, ..., $\alpha_m$ are elements of a Dedekind domain $R$ and $n$ is a positive integer, then one has
\begin{align}
  (\alpha_1,\,\alpha_2,\,...,\,\alpha_m)^n = 
  (\alpha_1^n,\,\alpha_2^n,\,...,\,\alpha_m^n)
\end{align}
for the ideals of $R$.\\

This corollary may be proven by induction on the number $m$ of the \PMlinkescapetext{generators (not on the exponent} $n$).
