The sequence 
\begin{align}
a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots
\end{align}
of complex numbers is said to be {\it of bounded variation}, iff it satisfies 
$$\sum_{n=1}^\infty|a_n\!-\!a_{n+1}| \;<\; \infty.$$
Cf. function of bounded variation. See also 
\PMlinkname{contractive sequence}{ContractiveSequence}.\\

\textbf{Theorem.}\, Every sequence of bounded variation is
\PMlinkname{convergent}{ConvergentSequence}.\\

{\it Proof.}\, Let's have a sequence (1) of bounded variation.\, 
When $m < n$, we form the telescoping sum
$$a_m-a_n = \sum_{i=m}^{n-1}(a_i-a_{i+1})$$
from which we see that
$$|a_m-a_n| \;\leqq\; \sum_{i=m}^{n-1}|a_i-a_{i+1}|.$$
This inequality shows, by the Cauchy criterion for convergence of 
series, that the sequence (1) is a Cauchy sequence and thus 
converges. \Box\\

One kind of sequences of bounded variation is formed by the 
bounded monotonic sequences of real numbers (those sequences 
are convergent, as is well known).\, Indeed, if (1) is a bounded 
and e.g. monotonically nondecreasing sequence, then 
$$a_i \leqq a_{i+1} \quad\mbox{  for each }i,$$
whence 
\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^n|a_{i+1}-a_i| = \sum_{i=1}^n(a_{i+1}-a_i) 
                            = a_{n+1}-a_1.
\end{align}                            
The boundedness of (1) thus implies that the partial sums (2) of 
the series $\sum_{i=1}^\infty|a_{i+1}-a_i|$ with nonnegative 
terms are bounded.\, Therefore the last series is convergent, i.e. 
our sequence (1) is of bounded variarion.
