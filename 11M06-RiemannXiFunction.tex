\begin{document}
The \emph{Riemann Xi function} $$\Xi(s) = \pi^{-\frac{1}{2}s} \Gamma(\frac{1}{2}s) \zeta(s),$$ (where $\Gamma(s)$ is Euler's Gamma function and $\zeta(s)$ is the Riemann zeta function), is the key to the functional equation for the Riemann zeta function.

Riemann himself used the notation of a lower case xi ($\xi$). The famous Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the assertion that all the zeros of $\xi$ are real, in fact Riemann himself presented his original hypothesis in terms of that function.

Riemann's lower case xi is defined as $$\xi(s) = \frac{1}{2} s(s-1) \Xi(s).$$
