\begin{document}
The {\em Prouhet-Thue-Morse constant} is the number $\tau$ whose binary expansion is the Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence.  That is,
\[ \tau = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{t_i}{2^{i+1}} = 0.412454033640 \ldots \]

where $t_i$ is the Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence

Another expression, not in \PMlinkescapetext{terms} of $t_i$, is

\[ \tau = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} \prod_{n=0}^{\infty} ( 1 - 2^{-2^i} ) \]

The number $\tau$ has been shown to be transcendental.
