\begin{document}
Given a base $b$ integer $$n = \sum_{i = 1}^k d_ib^{i - 1}$$ where $d_1$ is the least significant digit and $d_k$ is the most significant, if it's also the case that the $k$ least significant digits of $n^3$ are the same of those of $n$, then $n$ is called a {\em trimorphic number}.

All automorphic numbers (with $m = 1$) are also trimorphic numbers, but not all trimorphic numbers are 1-automorphic.
