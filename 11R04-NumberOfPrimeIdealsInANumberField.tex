\textbf{Theorem.}\, The ring of integers of an algebraic number field contains infinitely many prime ideals.\\

\emph{Proof.}\, Let $\mathcal{O}$ be the ring of integers of a number field.\, If $p$ is a rational prime number, then the principal ideal $(p)$ of $\mathcal{O}$ does not coincide with\, $(1) = \mathcal{O}$\, and thus $(p)$ has a set of prime ideals of $\mathcal{O}$ as factors.\, Two different (positive) rational primes $p$ and $q$ satisfy
$$\gcd((p),\,(q)) \;=\; (p,\,q) \;=\; (1),$$
since there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that\, $xp\!+\!yq = 1$\, and consequently\, $1 \in (p,\,q)$.\, Therefore, the principal ideals $(p)$ and $(q)$ of $\mathcal{O}$ have no common prime ideal factors.\, Because there are \PMlinkid{infinitely many rational prime numbers}{3036}, also the corresponding principal ideals have infinitely many different prime ideal factors.
